# react-native-space-x
This is my first time using the SpaceX api with TypeScript and React and I am very happy how things turned out!

I have learned so much from this App, about API calls, a lot about component styling, JavaScript libraries, Redux, React and TypeScript, 
plus many other things, mainly at the moments I found myself having difficulties. 

There is still many improvements I could do in this app, and I am very excited to try them! 

But for now, there is still a long road in the path of the learning!
